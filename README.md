# Monopoly-Simulation
Simulation of a monopoly game.
Standard rules apply, as listed on: https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly

Cards have been selected from a real game of monopoly.

The programme simulates a number of throws for two dice.
For all throws the number of passages for each spot will be recorded.
All 'kans' and 'algemeen fonds' cards have been included.
In the end the percentage of time spent on a spot will be displayed on the board.
This will enable players to select properties on which players will land relatively more; making winning monopoly more easy :)

The output can look like the following:
